This is a test that a potential front end developer has to solve. There is no _right answer_ although there is broken markup, an inefficient stylesheet and a laughable design.

## Instructions

This is a web page about J Dilla, the legendary record producer.

Your task is to create a new version of this `frontend-test` repo and make it a web page worthy of Dilla's timeless beats.
We would like to see your full commit history, so please commit and push regularly throughout. It's probably better to clone the repo and start a new one, rather than fork a public copy which might reveal your solution to other candidates. 

Your resulting page should take into account the following:

1. There are many things wrong with the HTML.
2. There are many things wrong with the CSS.
3. The page is not currently responsive.

_Any approach is fine. Feel free to clone and edit this repo, or throw it away and start again if you feel like it._

## Bonus points

1. Don't use a responsive framework
2. Use of typeface libraries
3. Improve the web page's usability and make it visually pleasing
4. use of angular.js in some shape or form


## If using HAML/SASS

1. `cd front-end-developer-test`
2. `bundle install`
3. `foreman start`
